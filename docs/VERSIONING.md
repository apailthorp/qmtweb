# Versioning & cache strategy

How the site stamps a single version, surfaces it, and makes sure a deploy
actually reaches returning visitors. This is the canonical reference; the
README has the short version.

## TL;DR

- The whole site has **one** version string: `v<semver> · <shortSHA>`
  (e.g. `v1.0.0 · a1b2c3d`), shown in tiny text at the bottom-right of every
  page.
- **You** bump the `semver` in `package.json` per release. The **short SHA** is
  added automatically at deploy.
- Asset freshness is **not** done with `?v=` query strings — it's done by
  serving markup + code with `no-cache, must-revalidate` (see
  [Cache strategy](#cache-strategy-the-important-part)). The version string is a
  human/traceable marker, not the cache key.
- To cut a release: bump `package.json`, merge through `development → main`, and
  the deploy stamps the build, tags it, and publishes a GitHub Release.

## The moving parts

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `package.json` → `version` | Semver source of truth (bumped by hand per release). |
| `scripts/stamp-version.mjs` | At deploy, replaces the `__APP_VERSION__` token in `index.html` with `v<semver> · <shortSHA>`. Exposes pure helpers (`buildVersion`, `applyVersionToken`, `shortSha`) for tests. |
| `site/index.html` | Carries the `__APP_VERSION__` token in three places: `<html data-version>`, `<meta name="app-version">`, and `<div id="app-version">`. |
| `site/js/version.js` | Reads the stamped version, renders the tag, hides it on collision with the footer, and records it in `localStorage` to detect cross-session changes. Pure helpers are unit-tested. |
| `site/styles.css` → `.app-version` | Styles the fixed bottom-right tag; `.is-hidden` fades it out. |
| `site/.htaccess` | Cache policy — the **actual** freshness mechanism (revalidation). |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | Runs the stamp step before upload, then cuts the git tag + GitHub Release. |
| `tests/unit/version.test.js` | Unit tests for the version + stamp helpers. |

## How the version is built

`scripts/stamp-version.mjs`:

1. Reads `version` from `package.json` (the semver).
2. Gets the short SHA: `GITHUB_SHA` in CI (sliced to 7 chars), else
   `git rev-parse --short HEAD`, else the literal `local`.
3. Composes `buildVersion(semver, sha)` → `` `v${semver} · ${sha}` ``.

The SHA changes every commit/deploy, so the combined version is unique per
deploy even when the semver hasn't been bumped.

## How it gets onto the page

The committed source keeps the token `__APP_VERSION__` in three spots so the
repo never holds a stale version. At deploy, `stamp-version.mjs` replaces every
occurrence (`applyVersionToken` is a plain string replace of all instances).

Locally (and in CI, which runs before the stamp step) the token is **not**
replaced. `resolveVersion()` in `version.js` maps the untouched token — or an
empty/missing value — to the string `dev`, so local pages show `dev` instead of
a raw placeholder.

## Cache strategy (the important part)

**Problem.** AccuWeb's LiteSpeed serves static assets with
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=604800` (7 days) and no revalidation. A returning
visitor keeps the cached CSS/JS for up to a week, so a deploy is invisible to
them — this is exactly the "private tab shows the new layout, normal tab
doesn't" symptom.

**Solution.** `site/.htaccess` overrides the header for markup + code:

```apache
Header always set Cache-Control "no-cache, must-revalidate"
```

`no-cache` means "you may store it, but revalidate before every use." Because the
server already sends `Last-Modified`, revalidation is cheap: unchanged files
return `304 Not Modified` (no body), changed files return a fresh `200`.

**Why revalidation and not versioned `?v=` URLs.** This site uses **unbundled
ES modules** (`main.js` imports `storage.js`, `search.js`, …). A `?v=` on the
`<script>` tag would bust `main.js` but *not* its imports — the browser would
still fetch `./storage.js` (no query) from the 7-day cache. Truly versioning the
graph would require either rewriting every relative import specifier at deploy
(fragile) or adding a bundler (against the project's no-build-step principle).
Revalidation makes the **entire graph** fresh — deep imports included — with zero
per-import surgery. So the version string stays a human-facing marker; the cache
is keyed on `Last-Modified`, not the version.

> **First-deploy check:** confirm LiteSpeed honored the `.htaccess`:
> ```sh
> curl -sI https://pailthorp.net/styles.css | grep -i cache-control
> # expect: cache-control: no-cache, must-revalidate
> ```
> If it still shows `max-age=604800`, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Cross-session detection

`recordVersion(version, storage)` stores the current version under
`localStorage["qmtweb.appVersion"]` and returns `true` when it differs from the
value stored on a prior visit. It's safe when storage is blocked (private mode):
it catches and returns `false`.

Today this is detection-only — there is **no forced reload**, because once the
assets revalidate the page is already fresh, so a reload would be a no-op. If you
ever want an explicit "a new version is live" affordance, wire it off the return
value, e.g. show a small toast or banner:

```js
const changed = recordVersion(version, localStorage);
if (changed) showUpdatedBanner(version); // your UI
```

(Avoid `location.reload()` as the action — modern browsers ignore the old
force-GET flag, so it won't bust the cache; revalidation already handles that.)

## Cutting a release

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` (e.g. `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`). Follow semver:
   patch for fixes, minor for features, major for breaking UX changes.
2. Open a feature PR into `development` (squash merge).
3. Promote `development → main` with a **merge commit** (see the branching model
   in the README — squashing the promotion diverges the histories).
4. The push to `main` runs `deploy.yml`, which:
   - stamps `v<semver> · <sha>` into `index.html`,
   - FTPS-uploads `site/` to AccuWeb,
   - creates git tag `v<semver>` + a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes —
     **only if that tag doesn't already exist**, so deploys without a bump don't
     create duplicate releases.

## Verifying a deploy

```sh
# Cache header is revalidating:
curl -sI https://pailthorp.net/styles.css | grep -i cache-control

# The stamped version is on the page:
curl -s https://pailthorp.net/ | grep -o 'data-version="[^"]*"'

# The release/tag exists:
gh release list --repo apailthorp/qmtweb
```

On the page itself, the version tag is bottom-right; it disappears when scrolled
so the footer reaches it (by design).

## Troubleshooting

- **`cache-control` still shows `max-age=604800` after deploy.** LiteSpeed may
  not have `mod_headers` active, or a higher-level config wins. Options, in
  order: (a) confirm `.htaccess` actually uploaded (it's intentionally *not* in
  the deploy `exclude` list); (b) in cPanel, check for a global "Cache" / Expires
  setting overriding it; (c) try a LiteSpeed-native rule
  (`<IfModule LiteSpeed> ... </IfModule>` / `RewriteEngine` cache headers) or set
  the header via cPanel's "MIME Types"/"Optimize Website"; (d) as a last resort,
  fall back to `?v=` versioned URLs + import rewriting (a bundler) — but that's a
  bigger change.
- **Tag shows the literal `__APP_VERSION__`.** The stamp step didn't run (e.g.
  deploying outside `deploy.yml`). Run `node scripts/stamp-version.mjs` against
  the file being shipped. Locally this is expected to read `dev`.
- **Tag overlaps the footer / never hides.** `version.js` compares the tag's
  rect with the `<footer>` rect on scroll/resize. If the footer selector
  changes, update `initVersionTag`. `rectsOverlap` is unit-tested.
- **No Release was created on deploy.** The tag already existed (no semver bump),
  or the workflow lacks `contents: write`. Both are in `deploy.yml`.

## Testing

- **Unit** (`tests/unit/version.test.js`): `resolveVersion` (placeholder → `dev`),
  `rectsOverlap` (collision geometry), `recordVersion` (cross-session + storage
  failure), and the stamp helpers `buildVersion` / `applyVersionToken` /
  `shortSha`.
- **E2E** (`tests/e2e/home.spec.js`): the tag renders, is visible on a short
  page, and is `position: fixed`. (E2E runs against unstamped source, so the tag
  reads `dev`.)
